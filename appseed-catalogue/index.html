<h3>1. Product Presentation</h3>
Products are  organised into categories with a title, a thumbnail and a price. Categories are displayed in card form with a title and a thumbnail.

The product screen provides additional information for each product including its price, description, a slideshow of images, a “Buy online” link, a “PDF” link and a “favorite” button.  The “Buy online” link points to the product web page where the user can proceed with the purchase. The “PDF’’ points to an  online pdf while the “favorite” button enables the user to add a product to their favorites list.

<h4>1.1 Home Screen</h4>
The application allows you to display several products on the home screen as a slideshow.  Create your virtual window display by presenting there your attraction products!

<h4>1.2 Favorite Products</h4>
The favorites screen gathers all favorite products in a list and present them in one place so users can have quick access.  Users can, also, send an email with the list of their favorites, for example, to ask for more information.

<h4>1.3 PDF and Buy Online</h4>
Online PDFs will give the chance to the buyers to be effectively and inexpensively  informed of your products or have access to instruction manuals and other support documents.

Apart from the PDF, each product can be accompanied by a “Buy Online” link so the User will be transferred to the page where they can purchase the product.
