They can also view its details, such as its authors and presentation duration, add it to their favorites or download a PDF if available.

<h3>Events</h3>

More details of an event are displayed on a separate screen including its description and location on the map. An event can be added to the user’s favorites too.

<h3>Committees</h3>

<h3>About</h3>
The About screen presents general information about the conference from its start-end dates and description to contact email and location. One tap actions for opening the device mailer with a pre-defined email already set and launching the map application installed on the device with the exact location allow the users to contact the conference organisers and get directions with a single move.

<h3>Signup/Login</h3>
Users can create an account or login through Firebase authentication. Once they login, they navigate to their profile page and stay logged in until they hit the “Logout” menu option.

<h3>Integration with Firebase for Backend management</h3>
The Conference Ionic app comes with a powerful, flexible solution for backend management, by integrating with Firebase. Firebase is a powerful platform for your mobile or web application, through which you can power your app's backend, including data storage, user authentication, static hosting, and more.

The Conference app reads data from a Firebase database and makes it readily available to all of the app users. As soon as your Firebase project URL is set, the app treats the content dynamically. The integration with Firebase offers easy data synchronization and data maintenance.

<h3>Data Sources</h3>
<h4>Firebase data storage</h4>
The app’s data is stored in Firebase as a JSON object and any data changes are synchronized with the app. You can use the Firebase UI to either import data that you have already prepared or create/manage your data in a tree structure. In the documentation, a full example of a Firebase project is demonstrated showing the required data fields and structure.

<h4>Data storage in JSON files</h4>
There is also the option to configure this app to fetch data either from a local location or a remote one (e.g. Amazon S3) where data are stored in JSON files. Basically, a single JSON file is the one responsible for all the business related information.  The source URL is set as a single variable in the application’s configuration file and no additional interference with the code is required.

<h3>Easy Configuration / Modular Architecture </h3>
Conference Ionic’s modular architecture is going to eliminate any unnecessary complexity for its configuration or modification/addition of its features. Its code is clean and well-organised into modules.
You could review this super-modular architecture by checking our SuperModular Ionic starter, which is provided for free. https://github.com/skounis/supermodular

<h3>Ionic design </h3>
Conference Ionic is based on the UI elements that the Ionic Framework provides. Ionic Framework comes with a detailed and impressive CSS framework for layout styling. Furthermore, it handles header elements in a very similar way to existing libraries you may have used. Headers are available in many different default color options. Adding a footer element is as easy as adding a header. Moreover, Ionic comes with its own icon library built in which contains almost everything you should need. Use Ionic’s UI components and they will give you a fully customized and functional UI.
