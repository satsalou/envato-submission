<h3>Signup/Login</h3>
Users can create an account or login through Firebase authentication. Once they login, they navigate to their profile page and stay logged in until they hit the “Logout” menu option.

<h3>Integration with Firebase for Backend management</h3>
The Conference Ionic app comes with a powerful, flexible solution for backend management, by integrating with Firebase. Firebase is a powerful platform for your mobile or web application, through which you can power your app's backend, including data storage, user authentication, static hosting, and more.

The Conference app reads data from a Firebase database and makes it readily available to all of the app users. As soon as your Firebase project URL is set, the app treats the content dynamically. The integration with Firebase offers easy data synchronization and data maintenance.

<h3>Data Sources</h3>
<h4>Firebase data storage</h4>
The app’s data is stored in Firebase as a JSON object and any data changes are synchronized with the app. You can use the Firebase UI to either import data that you have already prepared or create/manage your data in a tree structure. In the documentation, a full example of a Firebase project is demonstrated showing the required data fields and structure.

<h4>Data storage in JSON files</h4>
There is also the option to configure this app to fetch data either from a local location or a remote one (e.g. Amazon S3) where data are stored in JSON files. Basically, a single JSON file is the one responsible for all the business related information.  The source URL is set as a single variable in the application’s configuration file and no additional interference with the code is required.

<h3>Easy Configuration / Modular Architecture </h3>
Conference Ionic’s modular architecture is going to eliminate any unnecessary complexity for its configuration or modification/addition of its features. Its code is clean and well-organised into modules.
