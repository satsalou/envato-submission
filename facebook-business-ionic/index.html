    <h1>Facebook Business Ionic - Turn your Facebook page into a mobile app</h1>

Facebook Business Ionic turns your Facebook Page into a branded, independent, fully functional mobile app. There is no need to create and maintain your own backend as the Facebook Page is used for this purpose.
<br>
Facebook Business Ionic  exposes your business news, events, galleries, important information such as location, opening hours etc. to increase brand awareness. It provides a perfect way for your audience to reach you through direct actions such as “Call us now”, Send us an email, “Visit our Website”, “Get directions” etc.<br>
<br>
This app works seamlessly with your Facebook page with just one step configuration. Facebook is used as its one and only backend to provide the app with all the data it needs. Each time the Facebook page is updated, the app is automatically updated too.  New posts, events and photos are displayed instantly in the app without any further action.<br>
<br>
Best practices, proven techniques and experienced software architecture are packed with a well-crafted design.
