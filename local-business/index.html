Give your clients everything they need to find you by defining one or more locations of your business or store(s). Everything is so easy to be set in the blink of an eye! You only need to set the location(s) once and the application does all the work for you and presents it on the map.

<h3>Data Sources</h3>
<h4>Firebase data storage</h4>
The app’s data is stored in Firebase as JSON object and any data changes are synchronized in real time with the app. You can use the Firebase UI to either import data that you have already prepared or create/manage your data in a tree structure. In the documentation, a full example of a Firebase project is demonstrated showing the required data fields and structure.

<h4>Data storage in remote JSON files</h4>
There is also the option to configure the app to fetch data from remote sources (e.g. Amazon S3) where data are stored in JSON files. The News, Products and Services and Catalogs listing screens are fetching data from online sources by using the JSON protocol. The source URLs for these listings are set in the application’s configuration file. Images, Galleries, texts and whole entries can be updated by adjusting the remote sources. Also, Catalogs’ JSON model allows you to display more details of a catalog either by setting a url or by setting a pdf. Nevertheless, rebuilding and re-distributing the application are not required for constant updates.
The same applies for the pins in the live map too. The users are able to add and configure the pin points just by adjusting the remote source.

<h3>Articles and products listing</h3>
Four different content types are used and demonstrated in <strong>Local Business Ionic</strong>. The application provides the ability of forming Articles by adding a unique photo in any of them. Products, Services and Catalogs are similar to Articles but are supporting an unlimited number of accompanying images. An Image Slider is created by using them. Also, Catalogs JSON gives the option to the User to view a Catalog’s details either online or in a pdf file.

<h3>Push notification</h3>
A full working Push notification example is integrated into the application. It comes also with detailed instructions on how to configure everything in your end and have your application ready to send and receive Push Notifications.

<h3>Yeoman Ionic Framework Generator powered</h3>
Yeoman Ionic Framework Generator combines the best practices and features for scaffolding a hybrid application. It makes building of a mobile app easy and quickly since Yeoman is integrated with Ionic Framework and Cordova plugin. Also, the included Grunt build system optimizes and automates some important tasks of your workflow.

<h3>Modularity / Configuration</h3>
<img src="http://skounis.s3.amazonaws.com/public/envato/barebone-ionic/modular.jpg"/>

<strong>Local Business Ionic's</strong> extremely modular architecture is going to eliminate any unnecessary complexity. Its code is clean and well-organised into modules to make configuration even easier. A configuration file is responsible for each feature of the application such as:
The News
The Products
The Services
The Catalogs
The URLs for the remote data
Therefore, the configuration of all of the features is done through the services by which they are accompanied.

<h3>Ionic design </h3>
<strong>Local Business Ionic</strong> is based on the UI elements that the Ionic Framework provides. Ionic Framework comes with a detailed and impressive CSS framework for layout styling. Furthermore, it handles header elements in a very similar way to existing libraries you may have used. Headers are available in many different default color options. Adding a footer element is as easy as adding a header. Moreover, Ionic comes with its own icon library built in which contains almost everything you should need. Use Ionic’s UI components and they will give you a fully customised and functional UI.
