<h3>Integration with Firebase for Backend management</h3>
<img src="http://skounis.s3.amazonaws.com/public/envato/realestate-ionic/firebase.png">

The <strong>Real Estate Ionic</strong> app comes with a powerful, flexible solution for backend management, by integrating with Firebase. Firebase is a powerful platform for your mobile or web application, through which you can power your app's backend, including data storage, user authentication, static hosting, and more.

The <strong>Real Estate Ionic</strong> app reads data from a Firebase database and makes it readily available to all of the app users. As soon as your Firebase project URL is set, the app treats the content dynamically. The integration with Firebase offers easy data synchronization and data maintenance.

<h3>Favorites Screen</h3>
<img src="http://skounis.s3.amazonaws.com/public/envato/realestate-ionic/property-favourites.png">
Users can add properties to their favorites and gather them in a single place for quick access.

<h3>Map Screen</h3>
<img src="http://skounis.s3.amazonaws.com/public/envato/realestate-ionic/properties-map.png">
Map screen displays all properties as map pins. Users can easily access a store profile just by tapping a pin.

<h3>Comprehensive Property Presentation</h3>
<img src="http://skounis.s3.amazonaws.com/public/envato/realestate-ionic/comprehensive-property-presentation-intro.png">
<strong>Real Estate Ionic</strong> effectively displays all the necessary information for each listed property using relevant screens while engages the user with one tap actions.

In detail:

<h4>1. Property Screen</h4>

A detailed screen for each property provides plenty of information including a slideshow of property’s images, price, features and amenities.

<h4>2. Contact screen</h4>
This screen displays a description about the property, its address and a map pointing to the location of the property. It also enables users to interact with the app making one tap phone call, send an email or visit a website for even more details.

<h4>3. One tap actions:</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Call us:</strong> It will make the device to start a call to the phone number you have defined.</li>
<li><strong>Email us:</strong> Mailer will open with your owner’s/agent’s email already set so as the user won’t need to type it.</li>
<li><strong>Visit our Website:</strong> Device’s browser will be launched directing the user to a website with just one tap.</li>
</ul>

<h4>4. You are 25 km away. Get Directions</h4>
<img src="http://skounis.s3.amazonaws.com/public/envato/realestate-ionic/property-presen-directions.png">
The distance of each property from the user is calculated Users are able to find those near them and get directions. “Get Directions” button will allow the map application already installed on the device to be launched to show the exact property location on the map.


<h3>Data Sources</h3>

<h4>Firebase data storage</h4>
The app’s data is stored in Firebase as JSON object and any data changes are synchronized with the app. You can use the Firebase UI to either import data that you have already prepared or create/manage your data in a tree structure. In the documentation, a full example of a Firebase project is demonstrated showing the required data fields and structure.

<h4>Data storage in JSON files</h4>
There is also the option to configure <strong>Real Estate Ionic</strong> app to fetch data either from a local location or a remote one (e.g. Amazon S3) where data are stored in JSON files. Basically, a single JSON file is the one responsible for all the property related information.  The source URL is set as a single variable in the application’s configuration file and no additional interference  with the code is required.

Images, texts and whole entries can be updated by adjusting the remote sources without the need to rebuild and redistribute the application. All the content of the application can be updated just by adjusting the remote sources.

<h3>Easy Configuration/Modular Architecture</h3>
<strong>Real Estate Ionic</strong> is completely configured in seconds with the modification of a single file. Additionally, its modular architecture is going to eliminate any unnecessary complexity for the maintenance and/or extension of the app’s features. Its code is clean and well-organised into modules to make maintenance and extension even easier.
Also, you can review this super-modular architecture by checking our SuperModular Ionic starter, which is provided for free. https://github.com/skounis/supermodular

<h3>Yeoman Ionic Framework Generator powered</h3>
Yeoman Ionic Framework Generator combines the best practices and features for scaffolding a hybrid application. It makes building of a mobile app easy and quickly since Yeoman is integrated with Ionic Framework and Cordova plugin. Also, the included Grunt build system optimizes and automates some important tasks of your workflow.

<h3>Ionic design</h3>
<strong>Real Estate Ionic</strong> is based on the UI elements that the Ionic Framework provides. Ionic Framework comes with a detailed and impressive CSS framework for layout styling. Furthermore, it handles header elements in a very similar way to existing libraries you may have used. Headers are available in many different default color options. Adding a footer element is as easy as adding a header. Moreover, Ionic comes with its own icon library built in which contains almost everything you should need. Use Ionic’s UI components and they will give you a fully customised and functional UI.
