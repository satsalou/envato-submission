<h3>Why Ionic 3</h3>

Ionic 3 has significant improvements:

<ul>
<li>Architecture evolves and code style is cleaner. Best practices are applied for well organised, easy-to-follow and simple-to-read code.</li>
<li>Reduces the amount of code and polishes the user interface.</li>
<li>Ionic 3 components feel and look more native than Ionic 1.</li>
<li>Angular 2 brings better performance as Ionic 3 takes advantage of the opportunities provided by Angular 2.</li>
<li>Provides full control of navigation experience.</li>
<li>Sass is enabled by default and styling your app is easier. Also, material design is supported and animations are improved.</li>
</ul>

<h3>We Keep Staying Updated alongside with Ionic 3 and Angular 2</h3>

Since Ionic 3 and Angular 2 are still improving, we keep an eye on the changes and updates so we can improve and enrich Ionic 3 Toolkit Personal very often as the new technologies evolve. Follow along with us to see the practical demonstration of the new features of Ionic 3 and Angular 2. Many more to come with frequent new releases!

<h3>Navigation</h3>

The application follows the modern trends of the “Side menu” that is customized by Ionic 3 to look and animate uniquely depending on the platform the app is running on.

<h3>Remote data</h3>

The News and Products listing screens are fetching data from online sources by using the JSON structures. The source URLs for these listings are set in the application’s configuration file. Images, texts and whole entries can be updated by adjusting the remote sources meaning that rebuilding and re-distributing the application are not required for content updates.

<h3>oAuth</h3>

Keep users logged in the app by providing two different options: Facebook and Google account.
<br>
<br>
Ionic 3 Toolkit Personal app makes use of Cordova Oauth module and lets your users have quick access to any service requires a login process. Login information is maintained in the local storage of the app unless user taps the “Log out” button.
<br>
<br>
You are only one step away from the configuration of this feature. Just set the related ID of each login provider and you are all ready.

<h3>Articles and products listing</h3>

Two different content types are used and demonstrated in Ionic 3 Toolkit Personal. The application provides the ability of displaying Articles with a photo, a title and text. Products are similar to Articles but they support an unlimited number of accompanying images. An Image Slider is created by using them.

<h3>Slides</h3>

This screen displays a number of slides in a slide box brought by an online server.

<h3>Wordpress</h3>

Ionic 3 Toolkit Personal provides Wordpress support that is going to facilitate you to fetch and display the posts of a Wordpress website by simply replacing a single line of the code with the desired JSON feed source.

<h3>Drupal</h3>

Ionic 3 Toolkit Personal ensures an easy way to fetch and display the articles you choose from a Drupal website in a very simple and rapid manner just by placing your JSON feed of the articles in a single variable in the configuration file.

<h3>YouTube</h3>

Youtube playlists is fast and easy to be fed into the application. You only need to do two simple steps:

<ol>
<li>Provide the Youtube account username and</li>
<li>Provide your API key in a single code line</li>
</ol>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

Ionic 3 Toolkit is extremely modular architecture is going to eliminate any unnecessary complexity. Its code is clean and well-organised into modules to make configuration even easier. Also, a single configuration file is responsible almost for all the features of the application.

<h3>Ionic design</h3>

Ionic 3 Toolkit Personal is based on the UI elements that the Ionic 3 Framework provides. Ionic 3 styles the UI components based on the platform in which the app is being displayed rendering a native user experience. Also, it has new and refactored components, like alerts, segment control, search bar, tabs, and select inputs. Furthermore, theming is easier since changing the default styles is as simple as changing the pre-defined colors or the default value of a Sass variable. Moreover, Ionic comes with its own icon library which contains over 900 icons. Additionally, the actual icon can change, depending on the platform from which the app is running. Ionic’s UI components will give you a fully customised and functional UI.
