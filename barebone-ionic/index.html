A button from inside the app makes it quick and easy for the user to rate the app without a lot of hoops to jump through. You simply need to provide the url that will allow the user open the app directly and rate it. Besides, if the user does not make a decision to rate it on their own, the app itself will prompt the user displaying the related dialog each time they reach the number of predefined uses of the app. As for the configuration, you will need no time as just a single variable needs to be modified - no further coding is required.

<h3>Architecture</h3>
<h4>Yeoman Ionic Framework Generator powered</h4>
Yeoman Ionic Framework Generator combines the best practices and features for scaffolding a hybrid application. It makes building of a mobile app easy and quickly since Yeoman is integrated with Ionic Framework and Cordova plugin. Also, the included Grunt build system optimizes and automates some important tasks of your workflow.

<h4>Modularity</h4>
<img src="http://skounis.s3.amazonaws.com/public/envato/barebone-ionic/modular.jpg">
Barebone Ionic’s <strong>extremely modular architecture</strong> is going to eliminate any unnecessary complexity. Its code is clean and well-organised into modules to make configuration even easier. A configuration file is responsible for each feature of the application such as:
<ul>
<li>The RSS feeds</li>
<li>The News</li>
<li>The Galleries</li>
<li>The URLs for the remote data</li>
</ul>

Therefore, the configuration of all of the features is done through the services by which they are accompanied.
<br><br>

<h4>Ionic design</h4>
<strong>Barebone Ionic</strong> is based on the UI elements that the <strong>Ionic Framework</strong> provides. Ionic Framework comes with a detailed and impressive CSS framework for layout styling. Furthermore, it handles header elements in a very similar way to existing libraries you may have used. Headers are available in many different default color options. Adding a footer element is as easy as adding a header. Moreover, Ionic comes with its own icon library built in which contains almost everything you should need. Use Ionic’s UI components and they will give you a fully customised and functional UI.
