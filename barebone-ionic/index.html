<img src="http://skounis.s3.amazonaws.com/public/envato/barebone-ionic/restaurant-1.jpg">
<img src="http://skounis.s3.amazonaws.com/public/envato/barebone-ionic/restaurant-2.jpg">
Barebone Ionic can now give you the solution even for a more specific kind of e-shop! That is a Restaurant e-shop! Demonstrate the Restaurant’s menu and let everyone buy your delicacies in a few steps.

A list of restaurant menu items is displayed presenting the products details, images and price. Also, a full-featured shopping cart is included so that the user can add/remove the desired menu items. Then, two delivery methods (home delivery and take away) are provided and, by the time the process is completed, the user receives an order confirmation email making them aware of the ordered items and everything else that is needed according to a simple setting of the email contents.

<h4>Tinder and Swipeable cards</h4>
<img src="http://skounis.s3.amazonaws.com/public/envato/barebone-ionic/tinder.jpg">

<h4>oAuth</h4>
<img src="http://skounis.s3.amazonaws.com/public/envato/barebone-ionic/oauth-1.jpg">

<h4>PopUp context menu</h4>
<img src="http://skounis.s3.amazonaws.com/public/envato/barebone-ionic/popup-menu.jpg">
Countless times views that float above app’s content are needed either to show more info about the current view, select a tool/configuration option or present a list of actions to perform inside the view. <strong>Barebone Ionic</strong> app demonstrates Ionic’s popover element to make it easier for you to get started.

<h4>SQLite and Local Storage</h4>
<img src="http://skounis.s3.amazonaws.com/public/envato/barebone-ionic/sqlite.jpg">
SQLite module provides a full working example where the whole set of the CRUD operations is demonstrated. An SQLite database is initialized and a simple model is serialized and deserialized into and from it. All the UI required for this purpose is carefully handcrafted.

Is SQLite too complex for your needs? Persist your app’s data by taking advantage of <strong>Local Storage</strong>. Use Barebone Ionic’s sample code as your starting point and get the hang of it in no time! Local Storage module comes with everything you need.

<h4>Feedback</h4>
<img src="http://skounis.s3.amazonaws.com/public/envato/barebone-ionic/feedback.jpg">
Feedback module provides the user the option to compose and send a report which consist of, a text message, an image, a video and the geographic location of the device.

<h4>Rate this App</h4>
<img src="http://skounis.s3.amazonaws.com/public/envato/barebone-ionic/rate.jpg">
Ratings are beneficial for finding out the problems of your app and the improvements you could make. A button from inside the app makes it quick and easy for the user to rate the app without a lot of hoops to jump through. You simply need to provide the url that will allow the user open the app directly and rate it. Besides, if the user does not make a decision to rate it on their own, the app itself will prompt the user displaying the related dialog each time they reach the number of predefined uses of the app. As for the configuration, you will need no time as just a single variable needs to be modified - no further coding is required.

<h3>Architecture</h3>
<h4>Yeoman Ionic Framework Generator powered</h4>
Yeoman Ionic Framework Generator combines the best practices and features for scaffolding a hybrid application. It makes building of a mobile app easy and quickly since Yeoman is integrated with Ionic Framework and Cordova plugin. Also, the included Grunt build system optimizes and automates some important tasks of your workflow.

<h4>Modularity</h4>
<img src="http://skounis.s3.amazonaws.com/public/envato/barebone-ionic/modular.jpg">
Barebone Ionic’s <strong>extremely modular architecture</strong> is going to eliminate any unnecessary complexity. Its code is clean and well-organised into modules to make configuration even easier. A configuration file is responsible for each feature of the application such as:
<ul>
<li>The RSS feeds</li>
<li>The News</li>
<li>The Galleries</li>
<li>The URLs for the remote data</li>
</ul>

Therefore, the configuration of all of the features is done through the services by which they are accompanied.
<br><br>

<h4>Ionic design</h4>
<strong>Barebone Ionic</strong> is based on the UI elements that the <strong>Ionic Framework</strong> provides. Ionic Framework comes with a detailed and impressive CSS framework for layout styling. Furthermore, it handles header elements in a very similar way to existing libraries you may have used. Headers are available in many different default color options. Adding a footer element is as easy as adding a header. Moreover, Ionic comes with its own icon library built in which contains almost everything you should need. Use Ionic’s UI components and they will give you a fully customised and functional UI.
