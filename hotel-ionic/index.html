<h3>Push Notifications</h3>
<img src="http://appseed.io.s3.amazonaws.com/public/envato/hotel-ionic/ho-push.png">
Stay in close contact with your guests and send push notifications with valuable information. This app uses <a href="https://docs.ionic.io/services/push/">Ionic’s push service</a> for receiving push notifications.

<h3>Data Sources</h3>
<h4>Firebase data storage</h4>
The app’s data are stored in Firebase as JSON objects and any data changes are synchronized with the app. You can use the Firebase UI to either import data that you have already prepared or create/manage your data in a tree-like structure. In the documentation, a full example of a Firebase project is demonstrated showing the required data fields and structure.

<h4>Data storage in plain JSON files</h4>
There is also the option to configure the app to fetch data either from a local source in the app’s file system or a remote one (e.g. Amazon S3) where data are stored in JSON files. All the content of the application can be updated just by adjusting the remote sources.

<h3>Easy Configuration / Modular Architecture</h3>
The configuration of this app requires the modification of the sample JSON data we provide and is described in detail in the Start Guide that comes with the app. Additionally, the app’s modular architecture is going to eliminate any unnecessary complexity for its configuration or modification/addition of features. Its code is clean and well-organised into modules.
<br>
You could review this super-modular architecture by checking our <a href="http://github.com/appseed-io/supermodular2">SuperModular Ionic starter</a>, which is provided for free.

<h3>Ionic design</h3>
This app is based on the UI elements that the Ionic Framework provides. Ionic Framework comes with a detailed and impressive <a href="http://ionicframework.com/docs/components/">CSS components</a> for layout styling. Moreover, Ionic comes with its own <a href="http://ionicframework.com/docs/ionicons/">icon library</a> built in which contains almost everything you should need. Use Ionic’s UI components and they will give you a fully customised and functional UI.
