<br>
One tap actions:
<ul>
<li>Call us: It will make the device to start a call to the phone number you have defined</li>
<li>Send us an Email: Mailer will open with your business's email already set so as the user won't need to type it</li>

</ul>

<h4>7.1 Open hours</h4>

A list of the open hours is also displayed in the "Contact Us" screen.

<h4>7.2 Social networks</h4>
Restaurant Ionic app provides four buttons for the most popular social networks; Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest so clients will be able to see your social profile with just one click.

<h3>8. Remote data</h3>
There is also the option to configure Restaurant Ionic app to fetch data either from a local location or a remote one (e.g. Amazon S3) where data are stored in JSON files. The source URLs for Menu Categories and News listings are set in the application’s configuration file. Images, Galleries, texts and whole entries can be updated by adjusting the remote sources. Nevertheless, rebuilding and re-distributing the application are not required for constant updates.
<br>
<br>
The same applies for the pins in the live map too. In order to add and configure the pin points you just need to adjust the remote source.
<br>
<br>
Also, news and announcements about your restaurant can be displayed by using a remote JSON structure or your already existing Wordpress and/or Drupal site. Everything you need for that is already built and no additional code is required.

<h3>9. Easy Configuration / Modular Architecture </h3>
Menu categories and items can be adjusted by just updating their JSON files. They only need to be placed in the related folder and everything else is set up and ready to be used.<br>
<br>
Besides, Restaurant Ionic's modular architecture is going to eliminate any unnecessary complexity for the configuration of the rest features too. Its code is clean and well-organised into modules to make configuration even easier.<br>
