  <h4>6.1 Open hours</h4>
  Let users know if the restaurant  is open at the particular time they open the application.

A list of the open hours is also displayed in the "Contact Us" screen.

  <h4>6.2 Social networks</h4>
  Restaurant Ionic app provides four buttons for the most popular social networks; Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest so clients will be able to see your social profile with just one click.

  <h3>7. Remote data</h3>
  The Menu Categories and News listing windows are fetching data from online sources by using the JSON protocol. The source URLs for these listings are set in the application's configuration file. Images, Galleries, texts and whole entries can be updated by adjusting the remote sources. Nevertheless, rebuilding and re-distributing the application are not required for constant updates.<br><br>The same applies for the pins in the live map too. In order to add and configure the pin points you just need to adjust the remote source.

  <h4>7.1 Wordpress / Drupal or JSON News</h4>
  Display news and announcements about your restaurant by using a remote JSON structure or your already existing Wordpress and/or Drupal site. Everything you need for that is already built and no additional code is required.

  <h3>8. Push notification<h3>
  A full working Push notification example is integrated into the application. It comes also with detailed instructions on how to configure everything in your end and have your application ready to send and receive Push Notifications.

  <h3>9. Easy Configuration / Modular Architecture </h3>
  Menu categories and items can be adjusted by just updating their JSON files. They only need to be placed in the related folder and everything else is set up and ready to be used.<br>
  <br>
  Besides, Restaurant Ionic's modular architecture is going to eliminate any unnecessary complexity for the configuration of the rest features too. Its code is clean and well-organised into modules to make configuration even easier.<br>
  <br>
  You could review this super-modular architecture by checking our SuperModular Ionic starter, which is provided for free. https://github.com/skounis/supermodular

  <h3>10. Yeoman Ionic Framework Generator powered</h3>
  Yeoman Ionic Framework Generator combines the best practices and features for scaffolding a hybrid application. It makes building of a mobile app easy and quick since Yeoman is integrated with Ionic Framework and Cordova plugin. Also, the included Grunt build system optimizes and automates some important tasks of your workflow.

  <h3>11. Ionic design </h3>
  Restaurant Ionic is based on the UI elements that the Ionic Framework provides. Ionic Framework comes with a detailed and impressive CSS framework for layout styling. Furthermore, it handles header elements in a very similar way to existing libraries you may have used. Headers are available in many different default color options. Adding a footer element is as easy as adding a header. Moreover, Ionic comes with its own built in icon library which contains almost everything you should need. Use Ionic's UI components and they will give you a fully customised and functional UI.
