Except for the basic Firebase authentication, <strong>login with multiple providers</strong> (GitHub, Facebook, Google, Twitter) is allowed as well. Also, users can initiate <strong>password reset</strong> from the app itself. A password reset email is sent to the user’s email address to reset the password.

<h4>Real time data</h4>
Data updates are reflected on the mobile app immediately which is synchronised without refreshing or making a request to Firebase again.

<h3>Ionic design</h3>
This app is based on the UI elements that the Ionic Framework provides. Ionic Framework comes with a detailed and impressive <a href="http://ionicframework.com/docs/components/">CSS components</a> for layout styling. Moreover, Ionic comes with its own <a href="http://ionicframework.com/docs/ionicons/">icon library</a> built in which contains almost everything you should need. Use Ionic’s UI components and they will give you a fully customised and functional UI.
