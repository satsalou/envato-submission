The City Guide Ionic app comes with a powerful, flexible solution for backend management, by integrating with Firebase. Firebase is a powerful platform for your mobile or web application, through which you can power your app's backend, including data storage, user authentication, static hosting, and more.

The City Guide app reads data from a Firebase database and makes it readily available to all of the app users. As soon as your Firebase project URL is set, the app treats the content dynamically. The integration with Firebase offers easy data synchronization and data maintenance.

<h3>Review-Rate</h3>
<br>

A list of the opening hours is also displayed in the “Contact Us” screen.

<h3>Data Sources</h3>

<h4>Firebase data storage</h4>
The app’s data is stored in Firebase as JSON object and any data changes are synchronized in real time with the app. You can use the Firebase UI to either import data that you have already prepared or create/manage your data in a tree structure. In the documentation, a full example of a Firebase project is demonstrated showing the required data fields and structure.

<h4>Data storage in JSON files</h4>
There is also the option to configure City Guide app to fetch data either from a local location or a remote one (e.g. Amazon S3) where data are stored in JSON files. Basically, a single JSON file is the one responsible for all the business related information.  The source URL is set as a single variable in the application’s configuration file and no additional interference  with the code is required.

The News, Products, Services and Catalogs listing windows for each business are fetching data from online sources by using JSON structures too. Images, texts and whole entries can be updated by adjusting the remote sources without the need to rebuild and redistribute the application. All the content of the application can be updated just by adjusting the remote sources.

<h3>Easy Configuration / Modular Architecture </h3>
City Guide Ionic’s modular architecture is going to eliminate any unnecessary complexity for its configuration or modification/addition of its features. Its code is clean and well-organised into modules.

<h3>Ionic design</h3>
City Guide Ionic is based on the UI elements that the Ionic Framework provides. Ionic Framework comes with a detailed and impressive CSS framework for layout styling. Furthermore, it handles header elements in a very similar way to existing libraries you may have used. Headers are available in many different default color options. Adding a footer element is as easy as adding a header. Moreover, Ionic comes with its own icon library built in which contains almost everything you should need. Use Ionic’s UI components and they will give you a fully customised and functional UI.
