<h2>Highlights</h2>

<h3>User Authentication-Management</h3>
Users are able to register, sign in and reset their password. Through the administration interface, the administrator can create accounts manually, modify or delete the registered users.

<h4>Menu Builder</h4>
Restaurant menu is built allowing highly personalised orders with multiple sizes/prices and options with or without extra cost. Out of stock items can be marked accordingly so your apps can handle them.

<h4>Deals and Promotions</h4>
Bundle your menu items to offer a meal deal to your customers. Promote an item with a reduced price or apply an exclusive discount on the total amount of the shopping cart to make your app even more appealing.

<h4>Order Management</h4>
Your orders managed in a quick and simple manner. Use this powerful backend to manage your orders and see orders history with some simple points and clicks.

<h4>Business Setup</h4>
Important information for your business such as opening hours, photos, social media accounts and address are exposed to benefit your restaurant app. Opening hours could not allow an order placement, social media content could be displayed inside your app etc.

<h3>REST API</h3>
AppSeed Restaurant Backend comes with a well-documented <a href="http://docs.appseedplatform.apiary.io/">JSON API</a> that handles authentication and access to all the data that resides in the application. A single step is required in order to create an API user through the app’s interface and you are all set to make REST API calls. The API user will be authenticated with username/password using the basic HTTP protocol.

<h3>Technologies</h3>
AppSeed Restaurant Backend is based on the MEAN stack combining the powers of MongoDB, Express, AngularJS and Node.js. These technologies enable a dynamic, fast, robust and maintainable web application.
<br>
MongoDB holds all the data of the application and Express is responsible for providing the Web API and organising the app into an MVC architecture on the server side. AngularJS is used as a client-side MVC framework that provides a dynamic UI and reduces server load. Node.js enables the maintenance of a persistent connection from the browser back to the server where both the client and the server can initiate communication and exchange data.
