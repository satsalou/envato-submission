    <h3>Remote data</h3>
    The News and Wordpress screens are fetching data from online sources by using the JSON protocol. The source URLs for these listings are set in the application’s configuration file. All of the entries can be updated by adjusting the remote sources.Therefore, rebuilding and re-distributing the application are not required for constant updates.
    The same applies for the pins in the live map too. The users are able to add and configure the pin points just by adjusting the remote source.

    <h3>Push notification</h3>
    Your fans would like to get notifications from you for sure! A full working Push notification example is integrated into the application. It comes also with detailed instructions on how to configure everything in your end and have your application ready to send and receive Push Notifications.

    <h3>Yeoman Ionic Framework Generator powered</h3>
    Yeoman Ionic Framework Generator combines the best practices and features for scaffolding a hybrid application. It makes building of a mobile app easy and quickly since Yeoman is integrated with Ionic Framework and Cordova plugin. Also, the included Grunt build system optimizes and automates some important tasks of your workflow.

    <h3>Configuration</h3>
    Although extremely modular, Music Band Ionic app keeps the keys and ids in a safe place for security reasons and not in each related with the feature module. Forget any complicated configuration and do all of it in just one file.

    <h3>Ionic design</h3>
    Barebone Ionic is based on the UI elements that the Ionic Framework provides. Ionic Framework comes with a detailed and impressive CSS framework for layout styling. Furthermore, it handles header elements in a very similar way to existing libraries you may have used. Headers are available in many different default color options. Adding a footer element is as easy as adding a header. Moreover, Ionic comes with its own icon library built in which contains almost everything you should need. Use Ionic’s UI components and they will give you a fully customised and functional UI.

    <h3>Multilingual support</h3>
    Are you interesting in having multiple languages packed with this application? Check our <a href="http://bit.ly/cc-i18n">I18N Ionic Application</a> and learn how you can make it happen.
