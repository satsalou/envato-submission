There is no need to interfere with any complicated coding since the slight modification of of a single configuration file is all you need. Make Live Radio work like a charm just by defining the streaming URL and enjoy the automatic setup that keeps everything simple. In the same direction, all the Music Band Ionic’s features are configured in the same way by using that particular file.

<h3>Navigation</h3>
The application follows the modern trends of the “Slide menu”.

<h3>Firebase backend</h3>

<h3>Live Radio</h3>
<img src="http://skounis.s3.amazonaws.com/public/envato/music-band/live-radio.jpg"/>
Your fans are one step away to stay tuned from wherever they are. Make your own live streaming radio available for use simply by defining the URL of your stream.

<h4>SHOUTcast Metadata</h4>
<img src="http://skounis.s3.amazonaws.com/public/envato/music-band/stream-meta.jpg"/>
Music Band Ionic is focused on making user experience more fun! Static text and images can be boring. So, why not  exploiting the metadata the SHOUTcast streams provide and search for the artwork content of the current song within iTunes? Keep the users aware of the song title, artist and the corresponding cover while listening to music by enabling this feature with the modification of an individual variable.

<h3>Videos</h3>
<img src="http://skounis.s3.amazonaws.com/public/envato/music-band/youtube.jpg"/>
Youtube playlists and videos are so easy to share.  Promote your songs and see your videos views rising! Your fans won’t even bother searching for your official clips on Youtube.

Everything is so well-implemented and you just need to set your Youtube account username .

<h3>Instagram</h3>
<img src="http://skounis.s3.amazonaws.com/public/envato/music-band/instagram.jpg"/>
Instagram feature keeps the fans updated with Instagram posts. You only need to set the hashtag and Music Band Ionic brings and displays all the recent posts that are related with that.

<h3>Facebook Albums</h3>
<img src="http://skounis.s3.amazonaws.com/public/envato/music-band/fb.jpg"/>

Firebase offers real-time fully secure multi-room chat with a lot of features for an enjoyable chat experience. All the hard work is done for you so that you need the least effort to setup this feature.

<h3>Events</h3>
<img src="http://skounis.s3.amazonaws.com/public/envato/music-band/events.jpg"/>
Give information about the events your band is going to join. Let your fans be aware of your performances and participation in shows, commercials, charities etc. Events are organised in an easy-to-read calendar where the title and the event’s hour are displayed. This calendar is necessary if you want to allow your fans to do their plans to follow you everywhere!

<h3>Events Map</h3>
<img src="http://skounis.s3.amazonaws.com/public/envato/music-band/map.jpg"/>
Give your fans everything they need to find you by defining one or more locations of your band’s performances, activities etc. Everything is so easy to be set in the blink of an eye! You only need to set the location(s) once and the application does all the work for you and presents it on the map.

<h3>Social Media / Follow us links</h3>
Let your fans stay connected with you via Twitter, Facebook, Instagram or even via your own web site and let them chose the platform they prefer to stay in touch with you. Also, provide your website, eshop or itunes page and increase their traffic.

<h3>Remote data</h3>
The News and Wordpress screens are fetching data from online sources by using the JSON protocol. The source URLs for these listings are set in the application’s configuration file. All of the entries can be updated by adjusting the remote sources.Therefore, rebuilding and re-distributing the application are not required for constant updates.
The same applies for the pins in the live map too. The users are able to add and configure the pin points just by adjusting the remote source.

<h3>Push notification</h3>
Your fans would like to get notifications from you for sure! A full working Push notification example is integrated into the application. It comes also with detailed instructions on how to configure everything in your end and have your application ready to send and receive Push Notifications.

<h3>Yeoman Ionic Framework Generator powered</h3>
Yeoman Ionic Framework Generator combines the best practices and features for scaffolding a hybrid application. It makes building of a mobile app easy and quickly since Yeoman is integrated with Ionic Framework and Cordova plugin. Also, the included Grunt build system optimizes and automates some important tasks of your workflow.

<h3>Configuration</h3>
Although extremely modular, Music Band Ionic app keeps the keys and ids in a safe place for security reasons and not in each related with the feature module. Forget any complicated configuration and do all of it in just one file.

<h3>Ionic design</h3>
Barebone Ionic is based on the UI elements that the Ionic Framework provides. Ionic Framework comes with a detailed and impressive CSS framework for layout styling. Furthermore, it handles header elements in a very similar way to existing libraries you may have used. Headers are available in many different default color options. Adding a footer element is as easy as adding a header. Moreover, Ionic comes with its own icon library built in which contains almost everything you should need. Use Ionic’s UI components and they will give you a fully customised and functional UI.

<h3>Multilingual support</h3>
