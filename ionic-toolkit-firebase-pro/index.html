  <h1>Ionic Toolkit Firebase - Make the most of Firebase in every scenario</h1>

</ul>

<li><strong>Email</strong>: The email  client will open with an email address already set, so that the user won’t need to type it.</li>
<li><strong>Webpage</strong>: Opens a webpage in the device browser for viewing more details about a listing.</li>
<li><strong>Map</strong>: Opens a map with a pin where the listing is located.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Galleries</h3>
A minimalistic and clean interface for viewing photo galleries. Galleries are shown in a list with a title and a small description.
<br>
Tapping on a gallery transfers the user to a full screen slider to view all the images of that gallery.

<h3>Chat</h3>
Once logged in, the user is able to chat with all the other connected users in different chat rooms.

<h3>Authentication</h3>
Users can either log in or access the mobile app anonymously with restricted actions such as not being allowed to send a message in chat rooms or a post in the app’s activity feed. Except for the basic Firebase authentication, <strong>login with multiple providers</strong> (GitHub, Facebook, Google, Twitter) is allowed as well. Also, users can initiate <strong>password reset</strong> from the app itself. A password reset email is sent to the user’s email address to reset the password.

<h3>Admin Panel</h3>
The mobile app can be fully controlled through the Admin Panel provided as part of this toolkit. The Admin Panel is a separate Angular Application connected with your Firebase data. It makes managing your mobile app, creating new content and updating its components a breeze.

<h3>Real time data</h3>
Data updates are reflected on the mobile app immediately which is synchronised without refreshing or making a request to Firebase again.

<h3>Ionic design</h3>
This mobile app is based on the UI elements that the Ionic Framework provides. Ionic Framework comes with a detailed and impressive <a href="http://ionicframework.com/docs/components/">CSS components</a> for layout styling. Moreover, Ionic comes with its own <a href="http://ionicframework.com/docs/ionicons/">icon library</a> built in which contains almost everything you should need. Use Ionic’s UI components and they will give you a fully customised and functional UI.
