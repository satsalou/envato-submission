The API user will be authenticated using basic HTTP protocol for a username/password authentication.

<strong>Local Business Backend</strong> has extremely modular architecture that is going to eliminate any unnecessary complexity. Its code is clean and well-organised into modules to let you get a quick start over any kind of modification or extension of the existing code. Forms, styles and all the logic are put together into the related module of each app’s functionality helping you maintain or even explore the code in a comfortable way.

<h3>Technologies</h3>

<strong>Local Business Backend</strong> is based on MEAN stack combining the powers of MongoDB, Express, AngularJS and Node.js. These technologies enable a dynamic, fast, robust and maintainable web application.
MongoDB holds all the data of the application and Express is responsible for providing the Web API and organising the app into an MVC architecture on the server side. AngularJS is used as a client-side MVC framework that provides a dynamic UI and reduces server load. Node.js enables the maintenance of a persistent connection from the browser back to the server where both the client and the server can initiate communication and exchange data.
